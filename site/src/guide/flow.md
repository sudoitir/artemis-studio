# Flow

![The Flow graph: producers, addresses, queues and consumers in columns, with moving dots showing the rate on each path](/img/flow.gif)

The question an operator asks mid-incident is rarely *"what is in this queue"*. It is
*"who sends here, where does it go, and why is it piling up?"* Artemis answers each
part on a different screen — connections in one list, consumers in another, diverts in
`broker.xml` — and never the whole path at once.

Flow draws the whole path, for a cluster, in one view:

**producers → addresses → queues → consumers**, with diverts, bridges and the hops
between cluster nodes drawn around them.

## Reading the graph

Columns run left to right in the direction messages travel. Shape says what a node is,
so nothing depends on colour:

| Shape | Is |
|---|---|
| Pill | A client — grouped by client id, user or host (your choice, in the toolbar) |
| Tag | An address, with how it delivers: *every queue gets a copy* (multicast) or *queues share* (anycast) |
| Box | A queue; the bar under its name is its backlog against the deepest queue shown |
| Hexagon | Another node of the cluster, or a bridge target outside it |

An edge's **thickness** and its **label** carry the rate, and **dots move along it** —
faster and denser as the path gets busier. A dashed line is idle; a dotted one is still
being measured. Colour appears only when something is wrong, and the problem is also
named in words: *no consumer*, *stalled*, *not connected*, *on 1 of 2 nodes*.

Hover or focus any node and the full upstream and downstream path through it stays
bright while the rest fades. Select it to open its details: its figures, the flow into
and out of it with each rate's source and age, and buttons to focus the view on it or
open it in Queues (the queue itself), Addresses, Consumers, Producers or Connections.
The selection is part of the address, so a reload or a shared link opens the same
details. Flow itself never changes the broker.

Right-click a node, or focus it and press **Shift+F10** or the menu key, for its menu:
open the resource where it can be acted on, copy its name or link, and — for a client —
focus the view on it or open its connections. The menu never offers anything that
changes the broker.

The **Table** view lists exactly what the graph draws, sortable, for keyboard and
screen-reader use or for copying into a ticket. Each row has the same menu, from its
**Actions** button or the same keys.

## Which node is it on? The Split layout

In a cluster of several nodes, the question behind most backlogs is *which node* the
messages are piling up on. **Split** puts the graph beside a monitoring pane that
follows the selection:

- **A queue or an address** is broken down per broker node: its backlog, consumers,
  messages in and messages out on each. Above the table, the pane says in words what is
  uneven:
  - *92% of the backlog is on artemis-b* — one node holds three quarters or more of a
    backlog of at least 100 messages;
  - *artemis-b holds 9,000 messages and has no consumer; the consumers are on
    artemis-a* — a node with messages and no consumer while others have them;
  - *artemis-a receives 90% of messages in but delivers 50% of messages out* — a node's
    share of incoming messages exceeds its share of delivered ones by 40 points or more,
    at 1 msg/s or more.

  Otherwise it says *Balanced across N nodes*. A node that did not answer is listed as
  such, its figures read *unknown*, and it is left out of the percentages rather than
  counted as zero.
- **A queue** also shows its history per node, over a range you pick: one small chart
  per node, on one shared scale, so heights compare directly. These come from Metrics,
  and appear when the Metrics feature is enabled.
- **A client** shows its rates per node. Client history is not kept, so it has no
  trends.
- **With nothing selected**, the pane shows each broker node's totals.

Drag the separator to resize the pane, or focus it and use the arrow keys; drag past
its minimum or press **Enter** on it to fold it away. The size is remembered in this
browser. Only Split asks the server for the per-node breakdown, so Graph and Table cost
what they always did. The same per-node split of a queue is on the **Metrics** page:
scope it to one queue and turn on *Break down by broker node*.

## Bounded, on purpose

A production cluster has thousands of queues. Flow opens on the **40 busiest paths**,
ranked by messages in, messages out or backlog, and always says how many it left out:

> Showing 40 of 1,212 paths, ranked by messages in.

The totals at the top cover every path, not only the shown ones. To reach the rest,
raise the limit (the server draws at most 200), or **focus** the view on one client,
address or queue and widen it hop by hop. Focus, ranking, grouping, layers, the
table sort, the layout and the selection are all in the URL, so a link restores the same view.

Ranking uses half-decade buckets, so two paths whose rates differ by a few percent do
not swap places on every refresh, and a refresh that only changes rates never moves a
node.

## Where the rates come from

Every rate says where it came from and how old it is:

| Source | Used for |
|---|---|
| **Sampled clients** | Producer → address and queue → consumer, from each client's own counters |
| **Queue metrics** | Address → queue, from the scrape Studio already runs. A queue refreshed only by the slow sweep says *~5 min average* |
| **Broker keeps no count** | Diverts. Artemis does not count what a divert moves, so Flow draws the divert and says so rather than inventing a number |

A rate that cannot be computed yet reads **measuring…** — never `0`, which would look
like a path that stopped.

## Studio only samples while you are watching

Per-client rates are not something the broker keeps, so Flow samples them — **only
while a Flow view is open** on that cluster. The open view renews a short lease; about
a minute after the last one closes, sampling stops and the brokers see no extra
traffic from Flow at all.

While a view is open, each sweep sends **one request per serving node**, carrying
everything Flow needs: producers, consumers, diverts, bridges, store-and-forward,
temporary and filtered queues, and the dead-letter and expiry addresses. It counts
against the same per-node rate limit as every other Studio call. With several Studio
instances, one samples and all of them show the same result.

On a very large node, the number of producers and consumers read per sweep is capped.
When a node has more, Flow says how many it read out of how many exist, rather than
presenting a partial answer as a whole one.

## Layers

Routing is drawn in layers you switch on and off in the toolbar:

| Layer | Draws | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Diverts | An address rerouting (exclusive) or copying to another. An exclusive divert without a filter marks its address's own queues *bypassed* | on |
| Bridges | A queue forwarded to an address here or on another broker; *not connected* when it is down | on |
| Cluster hops | Messages a node moves to another node through its store-and-forward queue | on |
| Dead letter & expiry | Where a failed or expired message from each shown queue goes | off |
| Temporary queues | One node per client for all its short-lived reply queues | off |
| Studio capture | Studio's own capture taps, marked as Studio's | off |

A queue bound to a **wildcard** address such as `orders.#` is joined to the concrete
addresses it matches. That match assumes Artemis' default wildcard syntax, because a
`broker.xml` that redefines it is not readable over management — the view states the
assumption whenever it draws one.

## When something is missing, Flow says why

- A node that **did not answer** is named, with the statement that its clients are
  not shown.
- A node that **refused to list clients** is named with the `management.xml` access
  that grants it.
- A node whose **routing could not be read** still shows its clients, and says its
  diverts and bridges may be missing.
- A broker that **does not report the counters** a rate needs shows *rate unavailable*,
  not zero.

## Motion and accessibility

Motion can be paused from the toolbar, stops on its own when the tab or the graph is out
of view, and is **not drawn at all when your system asks for reduced motion** — width
and labels still carry every rate. Every node is reachable with the keyboard; Enter opens
its details and Escape closes them, returning focus to where it was.

## Settings

Under **Settings → Flow**, without a restart:

| Setting | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| Sampling interval | 15s | Never below 10s |
| Rows read per node | 5000 | The most producers, and the most consumers, read from one node per sweep |
| Observation lease | 60s | How long sampling continues after the last Flow view closes |

Viewing Flow needs `cluster:read`. The design is recorded in
[ADR-0080](/reference/adr/0080-flow-graph-elk-layered-layout-and-svg-motion) (layout and motion) and
[ADR-0081](/reference/adr/0081-demand-driven-client-sampling) (sampling), and the per-node breakdown in
[ADR-0110](/reference/adr/0110-per-node-metric-series-and-flow-breakdown).
