# What Artemis Studio is

Apache ActiveMQ Artemis ships with a console that manages **one broker at a
time** and has no idea a cluster exists. That is fine until the question you
have spans nodes — which it always does, because the interesting questions are
"which node is live", "where is the depth", and "where did that message go".

Artemis Studio is the other thing: **one instance across many clusters**, with
the cluster as the unit of everything.

It works against your **existing** brokers. There is no `broker.xml` rewrite
beyond enabling the management endpoints you almost certainly already run, and
nothing here starts a broker.

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Topology** | Live/backup pairs, replication state, shared-NodeID grouping, on one canvas. HA role is polled from every node on every cycle — never inferred from configuration. Two live in a pair is a critical split-brain alert. |
| **Cross-node resources** | Queues, addresses, consumers, sessions, connections and producers across every node in one virtualised table, attributed per node, updating over SSE. |
| **Message operations** | Browse, send, move, retry, expire, delete, purge — with a dry run that answers with the affected count without acting, a server-enforced bulk cap, and per-node outcome reporting. |
| **[SQL Console](/guide/sql-console)** | A restricted read-only SQL dialect over the messages in a cluster, including the body, with an optional retention-bounded index and a live tail. |
| **Request-reply tracing** | Requests correlated to their replies across addresses and nodes, with latency and timeout statistics against expectations you declare. |
| **Metrics and alerting** | Depth, throughput and consumer series in partitioned Postgres, with charts and rules that fire on what they measure. |
| **Governance** | Authentication on every endpoint, a dynamic role/permission model scoped global → environment → cluster, API tokens, optional OIDC/SSO, and an audit event for every mutating call. |
| **[MCP server](/guide/mcp)** | The same capabilities exposed to an assistant, under the same grants and the same audit trail. |

## Four rules it is built on

These are not aspirations; they are constraints the code is held to.

**Broker-friendly by construction.** Reads are batched — one Jolokia POST per
node, never one per queue — and tiered by how fast a thing actually changes,
behind a per-node rate limiter. Studio must never be the reason a broker falls
over.

**Safe by default.** Every destructive operation takes `?dryRun=true` and
returns the affected count without acting. Purge and delete require the
resource's own name typed into the confirmation. The audit event is written in
the same transaction as the command, *before* the broker call, and updated with
the outcome — so a crash mid-operation leaves a record that it was attempted.

**Never trust config for HA state.** Who is live is a question for the live
nodes, asked on every poll.

**Honest capability gating.** When a feature is unavailable because the
connection lacks a capability, the UI says so and shows the exact `broker.xml`
snippet that would enable it. Nothing is silently missing, and a capability that
has not been established *yet* leaves the control enabled with the uncertainty
stated — an absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

## What it deliberately is not

- **Not a broker installer or configurer.** It manages brokers you run.
- **Not a message-queue client.** The SQL Console is `SELECT`-only and the live
  tail is a poll, never a consume; neither can mutate anything.
- **Not JMX.** Jolokia HTTP is the primary transport, with the Artemis Core
  client as the second channel for notifications and faithful message I/O.
