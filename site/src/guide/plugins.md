# Plugins

A plugin adds to Studio what Studio does not do itself: screens, an API, assistant tools, settings,
background jobs and data of its own. It is **one `.jar`**, installed from **Administration → Plugins**.
You see everything it will be able to do before anything is installed, and most plugins start
**without a restart**.

::: warning A plugin is trusted code
A plugin runs inside Studio, with Studio's access to your brokers and database, and its screens act
with the rights of whoever views them. Studio checks every jar thoroughly before installing it, but
those checks stop accidents and misuse of the contract, not a determined attacker. Install plugins
you would run as part of Studio itself.
:::

## Install a plugin

![Installing a plugin: Studio inspects the jar, states what it will be able to do and shows the SQL of its database changes, then the administrator types its id and it is live without a restart](/img/plugin-install.gif)

Drop the `.jar` anywhere on **Administration → Plugins**, or choose **Install plugin**. Four steps
follow, and nothing is installed until the third:

1. **Inspect.** Studio reads the jar without running any of its code. It checks the descriptor,
   every class, and every database change. If Studio would refuse the jar, you see every reason at
   once, each with what its author must change, and **Copy report** gives it to them. Nothing is
   stored.
2. **Review: what this plugin will be able to do.** Each capability is stated as a sentence:
   - screens, assistant tools (read-only or changing things), permissions and settings
   - the database changes, with **Show the SQL**
   - what it depends on
   - for an update, what changes: permissions added or removed, and how many roles lose one
3. **Confirm.** The review says who is affected and for how long. You confirm it is you (below)
   and type the plugin's id. The button names the exact action, for example "Update Notes to 1.5.0
   (3 database changes)".
4. **Progress.** A timeline follows the activation as it runs. You can close the dialog: the
   activation carries on, and the plugin's row shows where it has got to.

A plugin's screens appear after you reload Studio. Anyone else who has Studio open is told that
plugins changed and offered a reload; nothing reloads on its own.

### Confirming it is you

Anything that changes a plugin runs code on the server, so it needs a sign-in within the last
**five minutes**:

- **Password accounts** re-enter their password. After five wrong attempts, the session ends.
- **Single sign-on accounts** sign in again at their identity provider, which asks for a fresh
  login. You return to where you were, with nothing you reviewed lost. The provider must report
  when you signed in (`auth_time`). If it does not, the step-up is refused.

Uploading and reviewing need no confirmation, because nothing runs until you activate.

## What needs a restart

Every change is classified before you confirm it, and does no more than it says:

| Class | When | What happens | Downtime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Instant** | No database change is pending | The new version starts while the old one keeps serving. Requests switch over once it is ready, and the old version finishes its work and stops. If the new version fails to start, the old one keeps serving. | None |
| **Brief maintenance** | The update changes the plugin's database | For a few seconds that plugin alone answers "updating", while its work drains, its schema changes and the new version starts. | Seconds, that plugin only |
| **Restart** | The plugin says it needs one, or a version did not stop cleanly | The version to start is recorded and starts with Studio. | All of Studio, briefly |

**When a restart is needed, Studio restarts itself if something will start it again.** It stops
gracefully: every plugin is closed and the stop is recorded as clean. Then it exits for its
supervisor to restart it. That works:

- **with the compose files**, which set `ARTEMIS_STUDIO_PLUGINS_RESTART_SUPERVISED=true` next to
  `restart: unless-stopped`. Keep those two together: remove one and you must remove the other.
- **on Kubernetes**, which Studio detects.
- **anywhere else**, once you set `artemis-studio.plugins.restart.supervised=true`, if your process
  manager restarts Studio when it exits.

Otherwise Studio does not stop itself. Exiting would leave it down, so it shows the command to run
instead (`docker compose restart studio`). The review tells you in advance which of the two will
happen.

Installers can also restart Studio from the Plugins tab, for example after a plugin that did not
stop cleanly. That needs the same confirmation as any plugin change, and it is refused within two
minutes of a start, so nothing can hold Studio in a restart loop.

## Update and roll back

- **Upload the new version** the same way as a new plugin. The review shows the difference from
  the version installed. A plugin can only be updated by a jar from the **same vendor**, and never
  to an **older** version: use Roll back for that.
- **Check for updates** asks each plugin's update URL, if it names one, for a newer version. The
  check happens only when you ask; Studio never contacts anything on its own. An update is
  downloaded over https only, without following redirects, and must match the checksum its vendor
  published. Then it goes through the same inspection and review as an upload.
- **Roll back** reactivates the version that ran before, instantly, as long as the current version
  **changed no database**. A database change can't be undone reliably once data has been written
  under it, so after one, Roll back is unavailable and says why. The review warns about this
  before you confirm, and flags every change that has no rollback of its own: take a backup first.

## Disable, uninstall, purge

| | Its screens, API, tools, jobs | Its data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Disable** | Stop; Enable brings them back | Kept |
| **Uninstall** | Removed | Kept, so installing it again picks the data up |
| **Purge** (after Uninstall) | — | **Deleted for good**: its schema, the roles' grants of its permissions, its saved settings, its stored jars |

Purge shows its reach first: each table with its approximate rows and size. You then type the
plugin's id. If another plugin requires the one you are disabling, Studio says which and offers to
disable them together.

## Who can install plugins

Installing a plugin runs its code, so this is **not a role permission**. No role and no wildcard
permission lets anyone install, not even one that can edit every role. Instead a short list of
**installers** can. It is checked on every request, so removing someone takes effect on their next
click.

- The **administrator Studio creates on first start** is the first installer.
- Or name them in `artemis-studio.plugins.initial-installers`, as a username, or
  `<registration-id>:<subject>` for a single sign-on user. This list is used only while nobody is an
  installer; after that, installers manage installers.
- An installer adds or removes others under **Who can install** on the Plugins tab, after
  confirming it is them. The last installer cannot be removed.
- Administrators who are not installers see everything, with the actions disabled and the reason
  beside them.

Plugins are only ever changed **from a browser session**. API tokens and the MCP endpoint are
refused, even an installer's.

## Licenses

A plugin that is sold can say it **needs a license**. Studio then shows its license state on the Plugins
tab, and a **License** tab in the plugin's drawer. Studio stores the file you upload, but it does not read
it: the plugin decides whether it accepts the file, and tells Studio. A plugin that does not need a license
shows none.

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| No license | The plugin needs one and none is uploaded. |
| Not checked yet | A file is stored and the plugin has not said what it makes of it. |
| Licensed | The plugin accepted it. |
| License expiring | Accepted, and it ends within 30 days. |
| License expired | It has ended. |
| Over its license limit | The plugin is used beyond what the license allows. |
| License not accepted | The plugin did not accept the file; its note says why. |

- **Upload, replace or remove** a license on the plugin's License tab. Like any change to a plugin, it needs
  an installer who has signed in within the last five minutes. A license file is at most 64 KB.
- **What a plugin does** without a license, or once one expires, is its own rule; the plugin's documentation
  says. Nothing else in Studio is affected, and a plugin that fails while checking its license affects no
  other plugin.
- **Health.** While a running plugin that needs a license has none, has one it did not accept, or has one that
  ends within 30 days, `/actuator/health/studio` reports `pluginLicenses` as `DEGRADED` and names the plugin. It
  is never part of readiness.
- **Audit.** Every upload, replacement and removal is recorded with who did it, the plugin, and the file's
  SHA-256 and size. The content of the file is never recorded.
- The file is signed by whoever issued it, not secret, so it is stored as is. Anyone who can read Studio's
  database can read it.

## Signing and trust

A plugin runs with Studio's own access, so Studio checks **who built it** before anything runs. Every plugin
jar is signed by its publisher with a key, and Studio installs a jar only if it is signed by a key an
installer has trusted. The signature also proves the jar was not changed afterwards: a file altered, added or
removed after signing is refused before anything is stored.

- **Trusted keys.** Under **Trusted keys** on the Plugins tab, installers add the publishers' keys (a PEM
  certificate or public key, which the publisher publishes) and remove them. Each key shows its
  **fingerprint**, the name you gave it, and the plugins it signed. Adding or removing a key needs a fresh
  sign-in, like any plugin change, and is audited.
- **Keys from configuration.** An installation that is built from files, such as an air-gapped one or one
  managed by GitOps, pins its publishers' keys in `artemis-studio.plugins.trusted-keys` instead. See
  [Pin keys by configuration](#pin-keys-by-configuration).
- **Trust this key.** Upload a plugin from a publisher you have not trusted yet and the review names its key
  by fingerprint and certificate subject. Compare that fingerprint with the one the publisher publishes (on
  their site, in their release notes), tick that you did, and choose **Trust this key**. Studio takes the key
  from the uploaded jar itself, adds it and re-checks the review. Never trust a fingerprint you only read in
  the same place you got the jar.
- **Signer changes.** An update may be signed by a different trusted key than the installed version. The
  review then shows the old and the new fingerprint, and you must confirm the change before activating.
  Likewise, an update that asks for a **new permission** highlights it and needs your confirmation. Studio
  enforces both on the server; a client that skips the confirmation is refused.
- **Unverified plugins.** By default a plugin that is unsigned, or signed by a key nobody trusts, cannot be
  installed, updated, rolled back to or enabled. An installer can switch on **Allow unverified plugins** in
  Trusted keys. It is **off by default**, changing it needs a fresh sign-in and is audited, and every
  activation it allows records `trust=unverified` and the fingerprint in the audit log. Such a plugin shows an
  **Unverified** badge, and needs the same confirmation on activation.
- **Sign-in plugins.** A plugin that offers a sign-in receives users' passwords, so **Allow unverified
  plugins** never covers it: it needs a trusted key, and its install or update needs a separate
  confirmation. See [Sign-in providers](#sign-in-providers).
- **Removing a key.** Plugins the key signed keep running, so removing a key never takes a plugin down, but
  they show the **Unverified** badge at once, and their next update is refused unless a trusted key signed it.
- **Health.** While any installed plugin is unverified, the `studio` health group in
  `/actuator/health/studio` reports **DEGRADED** and names the plugins, so a monitor notices. It returns to
  `UP` when the plugin is updated by a trusted key, its key is trusted again, or it is removed.

### Pin keys by configuration

Each item of `artemis-studio.plugins.trusted-keys` has a `name`, which the Trusted keys dialog shows, and a
`pem`: the publisher's PEM certificate or public key, the same text you would paste into the dialog.

```yaml
artemis-studio:
  plugins:
    trusted-keys:
      - name: Example Publisher
        pem: |
          -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
          MIIB...
          -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

As environment variables, with the item's number between underscores, for example in a compose file:

```yaml
environment:
  ARTEMIS_STUDIO_PLUGINS_TRUSTED_KEYS_0_NAME: Example Publisher
  ARTEMIS_STUDIO_PLUGINS_TRUSTED_KEYS_0_PEM: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    MIIB...
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Studio makes the trusted keys agree with the list every time it starts, **before any installed plugin is
started**, so a plugin signed by a configured key is trusted on the first boot with it.

- A configured key is added and shows **From configuration**. A key an installer added by hand with the same
  fingerprint becomes a configured one.
- **Its Remove is disabled**, and the API refuses with 409 (`configured-key`): change the configuration and
  restart.
- Remove a key from the list and restart, and it is no longer trusted. The plugins it signed keep running, show
  the **Unverified** badge, and the `studio` health group reports **DEGRADED**, as for any removed key. Keys an
  installer added by hand are never touched.
- **A bad entry stops Studio from starting**: a missing `name` or `pem`, a key that is not a PEM certificate
  or public key, or the same key twice. The message names the entry's number (`trusted-keys[1]`) and the
  reason.
- Every key it adds or removes is audited as `PLUGIN_KEY_ADD` or `PLUGIN_KEY_REMOVE` by the actor
  `configuration`, with the fingerprint.

Whoever can change Studio's configuration can trust a publisher this way, without a fresh sign-in. They could
already run anything in Studio, but treat the list like the rest of your deployment's secrets.

Trust is the key, not the certificate: a publisher who re-issues their certificate for the same key needs
nothing done. There are no certificate chains, expiry dates or revocation lists, so if a publisher's key is
compromised, remove it. Plugin authors: see [Sign your plugin](https://github.com/sudoitir/artemis-studio/tree/main/examples/plugin-template#sign-your-plugin).

## Security, in short

- **Checked before it is stored.** Studio reads the whole jar's bytecode without loading it.
  - **Refused shapes:** unexpected files; archive tricks such as duplicate or escaping entries,
    oversized entries and extreme compression ratios; and manifest attributes that change how the
    JVM loads code.
  - **Confinement:** classes outside the plugin's own package, and names outside its namespace.
  - **Refused calls:** `System.exit`, starting processes, `@Scheduled`, `@Async`, and database
    changes that run a command or a Java class.
- **Its data is its own.** Each plugin has its own database schema and a pool of 3 connections. It
  may not create anything in Studio's schema or reference Studio's tables. Activation fails if it
  tries, and the previous version resumes.
- **It uses Studio's permissions.** A plugin's API sits behind Studio's sign-in, and its
  permissions are granted through roles like any built-in's.
- **Everything is audited.** Every upload, activation, change and removal is in the audit log with
  who, from where, the jar's checksum and the outcome. Each step is also written to Studio's log,
  because a plugin shares Studio's database role and could, in principle, change the audit table.
- **The kill switch.** `artemis-studio.plugins.upload.enabled=false` switches installing and
  updating off. Installed plugins keep running, and can still be disabled and removed.

## Capacity

Each active plugin takes up to 3 database connections, next to Studio's own 10. Activation is
refused, with the reason, once that would exceed 80% of Postgres' `max_connections`. The Plugins tab
shows the current count.

When a plugin stops, its classes should leave memory. If a stopped version is still in memory a
minute later, the Plugins tab says so and recommends a restart. The compose files cap metaspace at
384 MB (`-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=384m`), so a plugin that does not unload cleanly fails loudly rather
than growing without limit.

## Configuration

| Property (environment variable) | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `artemis-studio.plugins.upload.enabled` (`ARTEMIS_STUDIO_PLUGINS_UPLOAD_ENABLED`) | `true` | `false` switches installing and updating off |
| `artemis-studio.plugins.initial-installers` | — | Who can install while nobody can: usernames or `registration-id:subject` |
| `artemis-studio.plugins.restart.supervised` (`ARTEMIS_STUDIO_PLUGINS_RESTART_SUPERVISED`) | unset: `true` on Kubernetes | Something starts Studio again after it exits |
| `artemis-studio.plugins.trusted-keys` (`ARTEMIS_STUDIO_PLUGINS_TRUSTED_KEYS_0_NAME`, `..._0_PEM`) | none | Publisher keys to trust, each a `name` and a `pem`; see [Pin keys by configuration](#pin-keys-by-configuration) |
| `artemis-studio.plugins.safe-mode` (`ARTEMIS_STUDIO_PLUGINS_SAFE_MODE`) | `false` | Start without any plugin |
| `artemis-studio.plugins.start-timeout-seconds` | `60` | How long a plugin gets to start |
| `artemis-studio.features.plugins.enabled` | `true` | `false` removes the Plugins tab and its API; installed plugins still run |

## When something goes wrong

A plugin can never stop Studio from starting. Studio is already serving before any plugin starts,
and each plugin starts on its own, within a time limit.

| What you see | Why, and what to do |
| --- | --- |
| **"This jar cannot be installed"**, with a list | Studio would refuse it. Nothing was stored. **Copy report** for the plugin's author. |
| **Failed**, with a reason | It did not start. If an update failed, the previous version kept serving. Retry, upload a fixed version, or uninstall. |
| **Failed: "schema at version X"** | The update changed its database, the new version then failed to start, and the change could not be undone. Upload a fixed version, or restore from backup. |
| **Incompatible** | It does not support this version of Studio (its `since`/`until`). Update the plugin, or uninstall it. It becomes active again by itself if Studio moves back into its range. |
| **Restart required** | See [What needs a restart](#what-needs-a-restart). |
| **Refused: "another plugin operation is in progress"** | One change at a time, across all plugins. Wait for it to finish. |
| **Refused: connection budget** | Disable another plugin, or raise Postgres' `max_connections`. |
| **A plugin's page says it could not show its screens** | The plugin is running, but its UI failed to load in this browser. The rest of Studio is unaffected. Reload, then check the plugin's row. |
| **Safe mode: no plugin is running** | Studio stopped uncleanly three times in 15 minutes, so it started without plugins. Or `safe-mode` is set. Fix or remove the plugin that failed, then restart normally. |

## Build a plugin

Start from the template:
[`examples/plugin-template`](https://github.com/sudoitir/artemis-studio/tree/main/examples/plugin-template).
It is a complete plugin, **Notes**, notes operators leave on queues, with every kind of contribution:

- an entity in its own schema, with a reversible changelog
- an audited service
- an API behind Studio's permissions
- an assistant tool
- a setting and a background job
- a metric with a default alert rule
- a page in every cluster, a navigation entry, a panel in every queue's details, and live updates

```bash
mvn verify
```

That builds the plugin into one jar: descriptor, classes, database changes and UI. Then it checks the
jar **exactly as Studio will on upload**, so a refusal shows up in your build, not in front of an
operator.

**What a plugin builds against:**

- **Java.** `io.github.sudoitir:artemis-studio` from Maven Central, `provided`. Use only the types
  marked `@PluginApi`: those are kept stable within a contract version. Anything else can change in
  any release.
- **UI.** [`@artemis-studio/plugin-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@artemis-studio/plugin-sdk)
  from npm. Its Vite preset, `studioPlugin({ id })`, builds a Module Federation bundle that takes
  React, Mantine and TanStack from Studio, so one bundle is small and matches Studio's look.
- **Versions.** Build against the Studio and SDK version of the **oldest** Studio you support. It
  becomes your `studio.since`, and Studio refuses the plugin on anything older.

**The rules Studio enforces** (the template's README explains each):

- **Its namespace.** One id, lowercase kebab-case with your organisation first (`acme-notes`),
  prefixes everything the plugin adds:
  - its API: `/api/v1/p/<id>` and `/api/v1/clusters/{clusterId}/p/<id>`
  - its routes: `p/<id>/…`
  - its permissions (`<id>:…`), settings (`<id>.…`), live topics and assistant tools
    (`<id_in_snake_case>_…`)
- **Its own package.** Classes live only under its `basePackage`. A library it bundles must be
  shaded and relocated under it.
- **Studio runs its threads.** No `@Scheduled`, `@Async` or threads of its own: contribute a
  `ScheduledJob`, and Studio runs it and stops it with the plugin. A job's scope says where it runs
  when several Studio instances share one database: `INSTALLATION` jobs (pruning, housekeeping,
  anything on shared rows) run on one instance per tick, and `INSTANCE` jobs (flushing a buffer,
  refreshing a cache) run on every instance.
- **Changes are audited.** Audit every change with `AuditService`, like Studio's own features do.
- **Its data is its own.** Its tables live in its own schema, with no foreign keys to Studio's. Give
  every changeset a rollback, or updates that apply it cannot be rolled back.

### Assistant tools

A plugin's `@McpTool` beans join Studio's MCP endpoint while it runs. Declare each one in
`plugin.json`, and **Studio checks its permission before your code runs**:

```json
"mcpTools": [
  {
    "name": "acme_notes_list",
    "posture": "read",
    "scope": "cluster",
    "permission": "acme-notes:read",
    "description": "Lists the notes on a queue.",
    "params": [{ "name": "order", "values": ["newest", "oldest"], "note": "Defaults to newest." }]
  }
]
```

- **`permission`** is one of the plugin's own permissions. It is checked against the API key's
  owner, as it is for every other call.
- **`scope`** is the scope of the permission, and Studio refuses a tool whose scope differs.
  **`scope: resource`** checks it on the queue or address named by the argument `resourceArg` (a
  required string the tool takes), of the kind `resourceKind` (`queue` or `address`), on the cluster
  named by the required string `clusterId`. A caller who may not read that queue or address is told
  *No such queue or address, or this key has no grant on it*, whether or not it exists, and one who
  may read it and may not use it is told which permission is missing.
  **`scope: cluster`** checks it on the cluster named by the tool's `clusterId` argument, which the
  tool must take as a required string. A caller without the grant is told *No such cluster, or this
  key has no grant on it*, exactly as for Studio's own tools, so the cluster's existence stays hidden.
  **`scope: global`** checks it globally, and a denial names the permission.
- **`posture`** is `read` or `write`. Annotate a `read` tool
  `@McpTool.McpAnnotations(readOnlyHint = true)`, and a `write` tool not: hosts decide from that
  annotation whether to ask the operator first.
- **`params`** are the accepted values, body shapes and notes your schema leaves out. `studio_help`
  shows them, with the permission and scope, to any model that asks.

Studio refuses to activate a plugin whose registered tools and declared tools differ, whose
cluster or resource tool takes no `clusterId` (or a resource tool no `resourceArg`), or whose annotations contradict its posture. Check finer rules
(such as a second permission for sensitive fields) inside the tool as usual.

### Messages and secrets

A plugin can react to messages, send them and keep credentials without a client, thread or store of
its own. Inject the two beans Studio puts into every plugin's context; each is bound to that plugin
and acts only on its own data.

**`PluginMessaging`** registers what the plugin wants delivered, and Studio makes it true on every
serving node, after every restart and failover, and undoes it when the registration is removed or
the plugin stops running:

```java
@Component
class Orders implements PluginMessageHandler {

    Orders(PluginMessaging messaging, ...) { ... }

    void watch(UUID clusterId, UUID operatorId) {
        messaging.register(new RegistrationSpec(
                "orders", clusterId, "ORDERS.IN", RegistrationMode.TAP, 1, operatorId));
    }

    @Override
    public Disposition onMessage(PluginMessage message) {
        // message.body(), .headers(), .properties(), .deliveryCount()
        return Disposition.ACCEPT;
    }
}
```

- **`TAP`** delivers a copy of every message routed to the queue. Existing consumers and producers
  are untouched. If the plugin falls behind, the oldest copies are dropped, and
  `registration(key).droppedCopies()` says how many. It needs the acting user to hold
  `message:read` on the queue, and Studio's broker role to be set
  (`artemis-studio.capture.broker-role`, as for capture).
- **`CONSUME`** makes the plugin one of the queue's consumers. `ACCEPT` removes the message.
  `REJECT`, an exception, or the plugin stopping first leaves it for redelivery, within the broker's
  `max-delivery-attempts`. `RELEASE` also leaves it on the queue, but without spending a delivery
  attempt: return it when the message is not the problem (the service your handler calls is down)
  and you are stopping the registration until it recovers. The broker offers a released message
  again at once, so releasing in a loop that keeps receiving only spins. It needs `message:read`
  and `queue:purge` on the queue.
- **`send(OutboundMessage)`** sends a body, headers and properties to an address. It needs
  `message:send` on the address.
- **`checkSend(clusterId, address, actingUserId)`** answers why such a send would be refused (a
  reserved address, an unknown cluster, a missing `message:send`) without sending, so a plugin can
  reject a bad target when a user configures it. `send` still checks every message.
- **Every registration acts for a user**, whose rights on the queue or address (through a role, a
  team or a share) are checked when it is made and on every pass after
  (`artemis-studio.plugins.messaging.reconcile-interval`, 10 s by default). If the user loses
  a permission, the registration is `SUSPENDED` and says why. It resumes when the permission
  returns.
- **Concurrency.** A registration's `concurrency` is how many messages the handler gets at once on
  each serving node: 1 to 32 for `CONSUME`, exactly 1 for `TAP`. Studio opens that many consumers
  per node. Any other value is refused, with the reason.
- **Flow control.** A `CONSUME` registration's consumers have no prefetch window (the Core client's
  `consumerWindowSize=0`): the broker hands a consumer its next message only once the last one is
  settled. At most `concurrency` messages per node are delivered and unsettled, the rest stay on the
  queue for any other consumer, and a slow handler is simply handed fewer messages. Nothing
  buffers in Studio or in the plugin.
- **Order.** With a concurrency above 1, messages are handled in parallel, so their order is not
  kept, except within a message group. Producers that set the same `JMSXGroupID` (`_AMQ_GROUP_ID`
  in Core) on related messages get them handled one at a time, in order, on each node: the broker
  hands every group to one consumer. For an order across a broker cluster's nodes, configure the
  broker's grouping handler. A concurrency of 1 keeps the queue's order on each node.
- **Threads.** Studio calls the handler on threads of its own, from a pool that only plugin
  handlers use: at most `artemis-studio.plugins.messaging.max-threads` (64 by default, at least 2)
  per node for consumers, and as many for taps. A handler that blocks holds its own consumer and a
  thread of that pool, never a thread message capture or an operator's session needs. Keep it
  bounded all the same: blocked handlers across plugins share the pool, and one registration's
  footprint is its `concurrency` threads per node.
- Queues under Studio's own prefixes and the broker's management addresses are refused.

**`PluginSecrets`** stores named values encrypted with Studio's secret key: `put`, `get`, `delete`
and `list` (names and dates only). No Studio interface returns a value, and a plugin should keep it
that way: accept secrets, never echo them. Purging the plugin deletes them.

### Metrics and alerts

A plugin publishes numbers an operator watches through Studio's own metrics: the time series, its
charts, Prometheus and the alert rules. Nothing parallel is needed on either side.

**Declare** each metric in `plugin.json`, with the permission that reads its series:

```json
"metrics": [
  { "name": "acme-notes:notes", "description": "Notes per queue.", "unit": "count",
    "subject": "queue", "permission": "acme-notes:read" }
],
"alertRules": [
  { "key": "many-notes", "name": "Many notes on a queue", "metric": "acme-notes:notes",
    "comparator": "GT", "threshold": 50, "forSeconds": 0, "severity": "INFO" }
]
```

**Answer for it** with a `PluginMetricSource` bean, which returns the current value per subject:

```java
@Component
class NoteCounts implements PluginMetricSource {
    public String metric() { return "acme-notes:notes"; }
    public Map<String, Double> sample(UUID clusterId) { return counts.perQueue(clusterId); }
}
```

- **When.** Studio asks on every tier-B scrape of a cluster (every 15 s by default). A call that
  throws or takes longer than two seconds is skipped for that scrape, so answer from what the
  plugin already holds rather than from a slow query.
- **Where it goes.**
  - The values are stored with the queue metrics and share their retention.
  - Prometheus shows them as `studio_plugin_metric{plugin, metric, cluster, subject}`.
  - Each value is per Studio instance.
- **Rules.** Threshold rules can watch the metric, with Studio's comparators, durations,
  severities and channels. A scope's `subjectPattern` narrows a rule to some subjects.
  - `alertRules` are created once on every cluster, when the plugin first runs and for clusters
    registered later. An operator's edit or deletion is never undone.
  - While the plugin is not running, its rules show "source unavailable" and do not fire.
- **Charts.** `MetricChart` from the SDK draws Studio's own chart of one subject:
  `<MetricChart clusterId={id} metric="acme-notes:notes" subject="orders" title="Notes" />`. The
  reader needs the permission the metric declares. `usePluginSeries` returns the same series as
  data.
- A source for a metric `plugin.json` does not declare refuses activation, and a metric read with a
  permission the plugin does not declare refuses the upload.

**Offer updates** by naming an `updateUrl` (https) in `plugin.json` that answers:

```json
{ "version": "1.5.0", "url": "https://acme.example/acme-notes-1.5.0.jar", "sha256": "…", "changeNotes": "…" }
```

Studio asks only when an installer chooses **Check for updates**. It downloads the jar without
following redirects, and refuses it unless it hashes to that `sha256`.

### Licensing

A plugin that needs a license says so in `plugin.json`, and Studio stores the file an administrator uploads
and shows the plugin's verdict. Studio never reads the file and knows no license scheme: reading it,
checking it and deciding what an invalid one means are the plugin's.

```json
"requiresLicense": true
```

Inject **`PluginLicense`**, which Studio binds to the plugin like `PluginSecrets`:

```java
@Component
class Licensing {

    private final PluginLicense license;

    Licensing(PluginLicense license) { this.license = license; }

    /** Runs when the file is uploaded, replaced or removed, on every Studio instance. */
    @EventListener
    void onChanged(PluginLicenseChanged changed) {
        if (!changed.pluginId().equals("acme-notes")) {
            return;
        }
        license.file().ifPresentOrElse(
                file -> license.report(file.sha256(), judge(file.content())),
                () -> { /* no license: act as your own rules say */ });
    }
}
```

- **`file()`** is the plugin's own stored file: its `content()`, its `sha256()` and when it was
  uploaded. It is empty when there is none. A plugin can read only its own file.
- **`report(sha256, verdict)`** says what the plugin made of that file: a status (`VALID`, `EXPIRED`,
  `OVER_LIMIT` or `INVALID`), when it ends, who it was issued to, and a short detail for the administrator
  (such as why a file is invalid). The licensee is cut at 200 characters and the detail at 500. Studio ignores a
  report whose `sha256` is not the stored file's, so a late report never marks a replaced file valid. Never put the file's content in the
  detail.
- **`PluginLicenseChanged`** reaches the plugin on every Studio instance when its file is uploaded,
  replaced or removed. Every plugin receives it, so compare `pluginId()` with your own. Check your
  license when the plugin starts and on a timer as well: an expiry is a moment, not an event.
- Studio shows `Not checked yet` until the plugin reports, and its health degrades after five minutes, so
  report every file you are given, including one you reject.
- **`StudioInfo.brokerInstances()`** is the number of broker nodes registered in the installation, a count
  with no names, for a license that is sized by it.
- Studio is not affected by a plugin's verdict, and a listener that throws is logged and isolated.
  Keep a license check cheap and never block on it.

### Sign-in providers

A plugin can offer a username-and-password sign-in, for a corporate directory for example. It answers
**who the credentials belong to**; everything else on the sign-in path stays Studio's: the login
throttle, the account lockout, second factors, the session, the audit trail and the group mappings.

**Declare** each provider in `plugin.json`, with the label the login screen shows:

```json
"identityProviders": [
  { "id": "acme-notes:corp", "label": "Corporate directory" }
]
```

**Answer for it** with one `PluginCredentialProvider` bean per declared id:

```java
@Component
class CorporateDirectory implements PluginCredentialProvider {
    public String id() { return "acme-notes:corp"; }

    public Optional<VerifiedIdentity> authenticate(String username, String password) {
        return directory.bind(username, password)
                .map(u -> new VerifiedIdentity(u.uid(), u.login(), u.mail(), u.groups()));
    }

    // Optional: which of these users has the directory lost? Called about every five minutes.
    public Set<String> noLongerValid(Set<String> subjects) { return directory.missing(subjects); }
}
```

- **What Studio does with the answer.** An account is keyed by the provider id and `subject`, so it
  must not change for a user. The first sign-in creates the account with `username`; a name another
  account already has is stored as `name@<provider id>`, and the provider is still asked about plain
  `name`. Grants come only from **Group mappings** on the provider's groups (or its default role): a
  provider cannot hand back a user id or grants, and a user matching no mapping is refused.
- **A wrong password is an empty answer.** It is answered, throttled and counted toward the lockout
  exactly like a wrong local password. A throw, an answer that is not valid (a blank subject or
  username, a field over 255 characters, more than 1,000 groups) or no answer within 5 seconds is
  treated the same, and `/actuator/health/studio` reports **DEGRADED**, naming the provider and the reason,
  until a call succeeds. Local sign-in never waits on a plugin.
- **Only a verified plugin may sign users in.** A plugin that declares a provider is installed only
  when a trusted key signed it, even with **Allow unverified plugins** on. Installing it, or updating
  it to add a provider, needs a confirmation (`signin-added`) and the review says the plugin will
  receive the passwords users type. If its key is later removed, the plugin keeps running but its
  providers stop signing anyone in at once.
- **Revoking access.** When the provider implements `noLongerValid`, Studio asks it about the enabled
  accounts of the provider and, for every subject it returns, ends the user's sessions, revokes their
  API tokens and trusted devices and audits `IDENTITY_REVOKED`. The account stays enabled, so a user
  restored in the directory signs in again. This pauses while the plugin is stopped, and stopping or
  updating a plugin does not sign anyone out.
- **Second factors.** A role that requires a second factor applies to these users like local ones: they
  enrol at their first sign-in and then give a code after the password. Their password is changed
  where the directory keeps it, not in Studio.
- Redirect (OIDC-like) providers, bearer providers and changing Studio's throttling, lockout or
  session rules are not available to plugins.

### Approval providers

A plugin can decide whether Studio's gated operations may run, for example by holding them until a
second person approves. **Declare** it in `plugin.json`, naming the permission the people who approve
hold, which must be one the plugin declares under `permissions`:

```json
"approvalProvider": { "approverPermission": "acme-notes:approve" }
```

Then expose **one** `ApprovalProvider` bean. A plugin that declares the block without the bean fails
its activation. A plugin may also contribute `GatedOperation` beans for its own operations; each type is
named `<plugin id>:<name>`, and no two operations share a type or a parameters record.

- **Only one provider.** Activating a second plugin that declares `approvalProvider` while another is
  meant to be active is refused (`approval-provider-exists`), naming the first. Disable or uninstall it first.
- **The gate follows what is meant to be active, not what is running.** From the moment the provider is
  being installed, and while it is starting, has failed, needs a restart or is incompatible with this
  Studio, gated operations are not run and the caller is told approvals are unavailable. Only disabling
  or uninstalling the provider disarms the gate. Updating or rolling back the provider keeps it armed.
- **Removal is announced.** Disabling or uninstalling the provider publishes a `PluginStatusChanged`
  event inside the same transaction, so what depended on it is cancelled together with its removal.
- Studio logs `approval-gate` at INFO when it boots and whenever the gate arms or disarms.

**The approver's page.** Studio's own Approve and Reject sit on every request's page. A provider that
needs more of the approver, such as its own checks or a second signature, contributes to the
`approval.decision` slot, which renders above them with the request (`heldOperation`) and a `refresh`
to call once the provider changed it. A vote needs a fresh sign-in, and `StepUpPrompt` asks for one
when the plugin's endpoint refused for that reason:

```tsx
import { useMutation } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { Button, Stack } from '@mantine/core';
import { pluginApi, request, StepUpPrompt, type SlotProps } from '@artemis-studio/plugin-sdk';

function SecondSignature({ heldOperation, refresh }: SlotProps['approval.decision']) {
  const sign = useMutation({
    mutationFn: () => request(pluginApi(ID, `requests/${heldOperation.operation.id}/sign`), { method: 'POST' }),
    onSuccess: refresh,
  });
  if (!heldOperation.canDecide) return null;
  return (
    <Stack gap="xs">
      <Button onClick={() => sign.mutate()} loading={sign.isPending}>
        Add my signature
      </Button>
      <StepUpPrompt error={sign.error} returnTo={location.pathname} />
    </Stack>
  );
}

// in definePlugin({ … }):
slots: {
  'approval.decision': [{ id: `${ID}.signature`, order: 10, title: 'Second signature', Component: SecondSignature }],
},
```

A mutation anywhere in a plugin's UI can be held too: its error is then an `OperationHeldError`, and
`notify.settle(error, …)` turns it into the "sent for approval" toast with a link to the request
instead of a failure. Queries under `heldOperationsKey` refresh by themselves: the shell holds the
user's own stream open on every page. `useUserStream()` shares that connection and returns its status,
so a view can poll while it is not `live`.

### Reading metric history

A plugin that wants the history of Studio's queue metrics, or of metrics plugins publish, injects
**`MetricHistory`** and names the user it acts for. The read runs as that user's account as it stands
now, so the cluster check, the permission a plugin metric declares, the retention limit and the
point cap are exactly those of the metrics API:

```java
@Component
class QueueTrend {
    private final ObjectProvider<MetricHistory> history;

    MetricSeriesResponse depth(UUID actingUserId, UUID clusterId, String queue) {
        MetricHistory metrics = history.getIfAvailable();
        if (metrics == null) return null; // the metrics feature is switched off
        Instant now = Instant.now();
        return metrics.read(actingUserId, clusterId, new MetricQuery(
                List.of("messageCount"), "QUEUE", queue, now.minus(Duration.ofHours(6)), now, null, null));
    }
}
```

- **Acting user.** Background work keeps the id of the user who configured it, as message
  registrations do. `readPluginMetric(actingUserId, clusterId, metric, subject, from, to, step)` reads a
  plugin metric, including another plugin's when the user holds the permission it declares.
- **One not-found answer.** A user who is unknown, disabled or without access to the cluster gets the
  same `NotFoundException` as a cluster that does not exist, so a plugin cannot learn which clusters
  exist. A grant removed between two reads turns the second into that answer.
- **Clamped, and says so.** A range older than retention, or a step finer than the data allows, is
  clamped, and the response has `truncated` set to `true`.
- `MetricHistory` is absent when the metrics feature is switched off: inject an `ObjectProvider`.

### Studio facts and shared UI

**`StudioInfo`** (Java) tells a plugin which Studio it runs on, for example to head a file it
exports:

- `version()` is the running version, such as `2026.10.1`, and is empty for a development build.
- `clusterName(clusterId)` is the cluster's display name. It is empty when the current caller holds
  no `cluster:read` on that cluster, exactly as for an id that does not exist.
- `brokerInstances()` is how many broker nodes the installation manages, backups included. See Licensing above.
- `clusters()` maps the id of every cluster the current caller holds `cluster:read` on to its
  display name, ordered by name. Use it to let a document name clusters and store their ids. Names
  are not unique, so say so when a name matches more than one.

**The SDK's UI components** are the ones Studio's own screens use:

- **`CodeEditor`** edits YAML or JSON.
  - It highlights keys, values, comments and punctuation. It folds, matches brackets and searches
    (Ctrl-F).
  - Tab indents. Escape then Tab leaves the editor.
  - Pass `maxHeight` to make it scroll inside itself, or `lineWrapping` to wrap long lines.
  - It validates nothing itself: pass your server's diagnostics by line and column.
- **`DataTable`** is Studio's one table. Describe each column once (`id`, a required `header`, an
  `accessor` for its plain value, an optional `cell` renderer, a `kind` and a `priority`) and pass a
  required `label` that names the table and an `empty` state.
  - **Columns size themselves.** There are no pixel widths. A `kind` (`text`, `identifier`, `code`,
    `number`, `time` or `status`) sets a column's bounds and font, and `min`, `max` (in `ch`) and
    `grow` adjust them. When the columns do not fit, the longest values are shortened first, then
    `low` and `high` priority columns are hidden (the Columns control says how many), and an
    `essential` column is never hidden.
  - **Two renderers.** The default is an interactive grid, always virtualised, with one tab stop and
    arrow-key movement, selection, a `rowMenu` and resizable columns. `variant="static"` is a native
    `<table>` for a small read-only set, and becomes the grid above 200 rows.
  - **States and size.** Pass `loading`, and an `ErrorState` as `error`. `height` is `'fill'` or
    `{ maxRows }` to be as tall as its rows, up to that many.
  - **The viewer's choices** (widths, hidden columns, order) are kept when you pass a `storageKey`
    prefixed with your plugin id (`acme-notes.notes`). The URL owns the sort: pass `sort` and
    `onSortChange`.
- **The page parts** are what every Studio page is built from.
  - `Page` is the frame, and `PageHeader` is the page's one h1, with a description, meta and
    actions. `Section` is a titled block, plain or as a card, and `Toolbar` is the row of controls
    above a view.
  - `EmptyState` is one of three kinds: `empty` (what the resource is, why there is none, and the
    action that creates one), `filtered` (needs `onClearFilters`) and `unreachable` (needs the
    `nodes`). `ErrorState` reads an `ApiError` and names the cause and the next step. `LoadingState`
    holds the space of what it stands for.
  - `StatusBadge` shows a state in words. `Stat` shows a figure, and `null` reads "Unavailable",
    never 0. `DescriptionList` shows terms and values.
  - `FieldRow` puts fields on one line, such as a name and a value, or a field and the button that
    submits it. Every input box stays on the same line whatever its label, description or message
    holds, and the row wraps when the window is narrow. Use it, not your own flex row, so your
    forms line up with Studio's.
  - `Notice` states something the operator should know about the whole page, such as a licence in
    its grace period: a title in words, a tone (`neutral`, `info`, `warning`, `danger`) and the
    text. A `danger` notice is announced as an alert, every other tone as a status. Use it, not
    Mantine's `Alert`, so a plugin's notices read and contrast like Studio's.
  - `ConfirmDialog` confirms an action, and a `danger` one is confirmed by pressing and holding its
    button (`HoldToConfirm` is the same control outside a dialog). `notify` shows a toast for the outcomes of an action: pending, succeeded, failed and
    partial.
- **`DiagramView`** draws boxes and arrows, laid out for you, for example the steps of a workflow.
  - It is read-only. Pass `nodes` (`id`, `label`, optional `kind`, `detail`) and `edges`
    (`source`, `target`, optional `label`, and `dashed` for a secondary path).
  - `selectedId` and `onSelect` tie it to a detail pane beside it.
  - Mark a node that has a problem with `state: 'error'` (or `'warning'`) and a `reason`. It
    shows the word and reads the reason out.
  - The diagram is one tab stop: arrow keys move between nodes, and Enter selects one.
  - `height` takes pixels or a CSS length: `'100%'` fills a sized parent, such as a resizable panel.
    Zoom in, zoom out and fit controls sit in its corner.
  - To let people change the structure from the diagram, offer choices and apply them yourself.
    The diagram never changes the nodes:
    - Mark an edge `insertable` and pass `insertChoices` (`value`, `label`, optional `group`) with
      `onInsert(edgeId, value)`. The edge shows a "+", and Insert on the box it leads to offers the
      same choices from the keyboard.
    - Pass `nodeActions(node)` (`id`, `label`, optional `danger` and `disabledReason`) with
      `onNodeAction(nodeId, actionId)`. A box's actions open from its "⋯", a right-click or
      Shift+F10. Give an action that does not apply a `disabledReason` rather than leaving it out.

### What the browser allows a plugin's UI

A plugin's UI runs in Studio's page, under the page's Content-Security-Policy. Beyond keeping scripts,
connections and workers on Studio's own origin, the policy has the browser refuse code that turns a
string into markup or script (Trusted Types):

- Assigning a string with markup to `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML` or `document.write`
  throws. Render with React, or build elements with `createElement` and `textContent`. Text without
  any `<` in it is still accepted.
- A script `src`, `new Worker(url)` and `eval` throw. Bundle what you need into your own files.
- An inline event-handler attribute such as `onclick="…"` never runs. Use React's `onClick`.
- `javascript:` addresses are not links. Studio's own links to a plugin's vendor, icon and start
  paths go through a check that allows only `http:`, `https:`, `mailto:` and Studio's own address.

React, Mantine and the SDK's components work as they are. A library of your own that sets `innerHTML`
(a rich-text editor, a Markdown renderer) is what to check: it stops working here. Pick one that renders
through React, or show the text as text.

### Moving a plugin from contract 12 to 13

Contract 13 changes what an approval provider returns and how a plugin confirms a destructive action.
Studio refuses a plugin built for contract 12 with "built for extension contract 12", so rebuild it and set
`<studio.contract>13</studio.contract>` in its `pom.xml`:

- **The requester's reason is gone.** `GateDecision.Hold` is `Hold(policy, ttl, approverHint)`, with no
  `reasonRequired`; `GateRequest` and `GatePreview` carry no reason; `GateContext.REASON`,
  `REASON_HEADER` and `REASON_ARGUMENT` and `ApprovalReasonRequiredException` are removed, and Studio
  ignores the `X-Studio-Approval-Reason` header. A policy that needs context for its approvers reads it from
  the operation, its effect and its display rows. An approver still gives a reason when rejecting.
- **A provider can say whether it holds anything.** `ApprovalProvider.enforcing()` defaults to `true`.
  Return `false` while there is no policy (setup mode), so Studio does not require two approvers of an
  installation that asks nobody to approve. Inject `ApproverPool` and refuse to start holding while
  `quorate()` is false: a request needs someone other than its requester, so one approver locks the gate.
  While the provider enforces, Studio refuses an access change that would take the approvers below
  two (`approver-quorum`, HTTP 409).
- **Destructive confirmations are held, not typed.** `ConfirmByTyping` and `ConfirmDialog`'s `typedName` are
  gone from the SDK. A `ConfirmDialog` with `tone="danger"` is confirmed by pressing and holding its button,
  and `HoldToConfirm` is exported for a confirmation outside a dialog. Name the action and its count in the
  label (`Delete 37 queues`). A UI test holds the button (mouse down, wait the hold, mouse up) instead of
  typing a name.
- **Administration and Settings are links, not tabs.** A section is `role="link"` with
  `aria-current="page"` in a navigation named after the page, and its content is a group named by the
  section; a test that found `role="tab"` finds a link.

### Moving a plugin from contract 11 to 12

Contract 12 adds the approval gate's types (`io.github.sudoitir.artemisstudio.kernel.gate`): what a
gated operation declares, and the `ApprovalProvider` interface a plugin can implement to decide which
operations need a second person's approval. Studio refuses a plugin built for contract 11 with "built for
extension contract 11", so rebuild it and set `<studio.contract>12</studio.contract>` in its `pom.xml`.

The Administration page now lists its tabs in a vertical navigation under four headings, so a plugin
that adds an Administration tab (`admin.tabs`) names the one it belongs under in `group`:

| `group` | For |
| --- | --- |
| `access` | who can sign in and what they may do |
| `installation` | what is installed and where it runs |
| `governance` | the rules data and changes follow |
| `support` | what helps when something is wrong |

```ts
slots: {
  'admin.tabs': [{ id: 'acme-notes.policy', order: 60, title: 'Note policy', group: 'governance', Component: NotePolicy }],
},
```

The SDK exports the headings as `ADMIN_GROUPS`, and its typings require `group`. Studio refuses a plugin
whose Administration tab names no group, or one not in the list, with "names no administration group".
Nothing else in an existing plugin has to change.

### Moving a plugin from contract 10 to 11

Contract 11 lets a plugin decide, filter and guard permissions on one queue or address, and lets its
assistant tools and scheduled work follow. Studio refuses a plugin built for contract 10 with "built for
extension contract 10", so rebuild it and set `<studio.contract>11</studio.contract>` in its `pom.xml`:

- An assistant tool's `scope` must be the scope of its permission (`resource`, `cluster` or `global`),
  and a `resource` tool names `resourceArg`, the string argument that holds the queue or address, and
  `resourceKind`. A tool whose scope differs from its permission's, or a resource tool without them, is
  refused when the plugin is activated.
- A permission you check against a queue or address should be `resource`, and be checked with
  `ClusterAccessGuard.requireResource` rather than `@PreAuthorize("@perm.can(#clusterId, …)")`, which
  asks about the cluster as a whole and is never satisfied by a team.
- A message registration (`RegistrationSpec`) is checked on its queue and a send on its address, for the
  acting user, not on the cluster.
- Scheduled work that acts for a user is published as `OwnerWork`, naming the permissions and resources
  it needs. Studio refuses the publish naming each missing one, checks again before every run, and
  suspends the work with the reason when the owner loses one.
- In the UI, `useCan().can(permission, { clusterId, kind, name })` answers for one queue or address, and
  adding the row's `allowedActions` answers with no request.

### Moving a plugin from contract 9 to 10

Contract 10 makes permissions resource-scoped. Studio refuses a plugin built for contract 9, so
rebuild it against the new API and set `<studio.contract>10</studio.contract>` in its `pom.xml`:

- In `plugin.json`, each permission declares `scope` (`global`, `cluster` or `resource`) in place of
  `globalOnly`; a `resource` permission also lists `resourceKinds` (`queue`, `address`). A manifest
  that still says `globalOnly` is refused at install.
- `PermissionResolver`'s constructor changed (a plugin receives it as a bean and never builds it),
  and `StudioPrincipal.grants()` is gone: ask `PermissionResolver.can(...)` instead of reading
  grants. A check on one queue or address passes a `ResourceRef`.
- A plugin's UI runs under Trusted Types: see [what the browser allows a plugin's UI](#what-the-browser-allows-a-plugin-s-ui).

### Moving a plugin from contract 8 to 9

Contract 9 replaces `VirtualTable` with the parts above. Studio refuses a plugin built for contract
8 with "built for extension contract 8", so rebuild it against the new SDK and set
`<studio.contract>9</studio.contract>` in its `pom.xml`:

- `VirtualTable` becomes `DataTable`, and `GridColumn` becomes `Column`.
- A column's `width` is gone. Choose its `kind` and `priority`, and `min` and `max` where the
  defaults do not suit. Every column needs a `kind` and a `priority`.
- `compact` becomes `height={{ maxRows }}`.
- `emptyLabel` becomes `empty={<EmptyState … />}`.
- `label` is required.
- The widths a viewer had stored are not read: they reset once.
- The `pine` colour is gone. Use the theme's primary colour.
- Replace a plugin's own headings, empty states and red alerts with `PageHeader`, `Section`,
  `EmptyState` and `ErrorState`.
- `notify` is no longer Mantine's `notifications`: call its `succeeded`, `failed`, `pending` and
  `partial` instead of `show`.

## Permissions on queues and addresses

A permission declared `"scope": "resource"` acts on one queue or address, so it is held through a
role granted at global, environment or cluster scope, through a team role on the team that owns the
name, or through a share. Check it the way Studio does, so your answers are exactly Studio's:

- **`ClusterAccessGuard.requireResource(clusterId, ResourceRef.queue(name), "acme-notes:read")`**
  guards one operation. A caller who may not read the queue gets the not-found a missing one gets
  (a `NotFoundException`, HTTP 404), and one who may read it and may not do this is refused naming the
  permission and the queue (HTTP 403, problem `resource-forbidden`). `requireAll` checks several
  resources before anything is done.
- **`PermissionResolver.can(clusterId, ResourceRef, action)`** answers for the current user, and
  `can(principal, clusterId, ResourceRef, action)` for another, such as the owner of work that runs later.
- **`PermissionResolver.filter(clusterId, ResourceKind.QUEUE)`** returns a `ResourceFilter` for a list: call
  `readable(name)` for each row, and `allowedActions(name)` for the actions the caller holds on it, yours
  included. Filter before you sort, page and count, so a total never counts what the caller cannot see.
  `everything()` is true for a caller who reads the whole cluster, so they pay nothing for it.

In the UI, `useCan().can('acme-notes:write', { clusterId, kind: 'queue', name })` answers for one queue or
address, and `allowedActions` on a row you already fetched answers with no request:
`can('acme-notes:write', { clusterId, kind: 'queue', name, allowedActions: row.allowedActions })`.
`can(permission, clusterId)` is about the cluster as a whole, which a team's rights never reach.

### Work that runs later as its owner

Inject **`OwnerWork`** for a schedule, a rule or a sync that runs after the request that created it,
as a user. Declare what the work needs when you publish it, and ask before each run:

```java
work.publish("forward-orders", ownerId, List.of(
        WorkNeed.on(clusterId, ResourceRef.queue("orders.in"), "message:move"),
        WorkNeed.on(clusterId, ResourceRef.address("billing.in"), "message:send")));

// on every run
if (work.beforeRun("forward-orders").runnable()) {
    // ... do the work
}
```

- `publish` is refused, with every need the owner lacks named (`message:send on address billing.in of
  cluster …`), and nothing is stored.
- `beforeRun` checks the needs against the owner's account as it stands now. When they have lost one,
  the work is **suspended** with the reason, which is kept and audited. It stays suspended when the
  rights return, until someone calls `enable`, which is refused while a need is still missing. A
  plugin offers that as an Enable button.
- `status`, `all` and `withdraw` read and remove the plugin's own work. Purging the plugin removes it.

## How it works

Each plugin runs in its own Spring context, with its own class loader, schema and connection pool.
One gateway routes its API, and Studio's registries take and drop its contributions at runtime. Its
