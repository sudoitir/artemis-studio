# Teams and permissions

Studio decides who may see and do what with roles, granted for the whole installation, one
environment or one cluster, and with **teams**, which own queues and addresses by name. Several
teams can share one broker cluster, and each sees and operates only what it owns.

## Roles and where a permission acts

A role is a set of permissions such as `queue:read`, `message:send` or `queue:purge`. Each
permission acts at one of three levels, shown as a badge in the role editor:

- **Global**: only a grant for the whole installation gives it (managing users, environments,
  settings).
- **Cluster**: a grant for the installation, the cluster's environment, or the cluster itself
  (broker configuration, closing connections, alerts).
- **Resource**: one queue or address. A grant gives it on every resource the grant covers; a team
  role or a share gives it only on the names the team owns or receives.

Some permissions need others: `queue:purge` needs `queue:read`, `message:send` needs
`address:read`. The role editor adds what is required and says so, and Studio refuses a role that
lacks it.

Grant roles to users or directory groups under **Settings → Access → Users** or **Group mapping**,
choosing the whole installation, an environment or a cluster. A change applies on the user's next
request, without signing in again.

Studio ships **Administrator**, **Operator** and **Viewer**, and three team roles: **Team Viewer**
(see and browse), **Team Operator** (send, move, delete, purge, pause, create inside the team's
names) and **Team Admin** (also manages the team's user members).

## Teams

Create teams under **Settings → Access → Teams**. A team has:

- **Patterns**: the queue and address names it owns on each cluster, in the broker's wildcard
  syntax: `.` separates words, `*` matches exactly one word, `#` any number. `orders.#` owns
  `orders.in` and `orders.eu.retry`. Two teams' patterns may not overlap on a cluster; the editor
  says which team and pattern a new one collides with, and shows how many queues and addresses it
  matches today before you save.
- **Members**: users and directory groups, each with a team role. Adding a directory group can
  admit its users to Studio, so it needs `user:admin`; a team admin manages user members only, and
  never gives anyone more than they hold themselves.
- **Shares**: part of what a team owns, given to another team at a chosen team role, for example
  Orders sharing `orders.events.#` with Billing as Team Viewer.
- **Unowned**: the queues and addresses on a cluster no team owns yet, with an action to assign
  them.

## What a team member sees

- Lists, counts and totals contain only what the member may read; another team's queue answers
  "not found", exactly like a queue that does not exist.
- Each queue and address shows the team that owns it.
- An action the member may not take on something they can see is shown disabled, with the missing
  permission and whom to ask. Target pickers offer only addresses they may send to; creating a
  queue shows the names they may create under.
- Moving or transferring messages needs the right on both ends.
- Live updates, the audit trail, metrics, alerts, the SQL console, captures, API tokens and the MCP
  tools follow the same rules.

## Explaining access

**Access check** (on a user, under Users) answers, for a cluster and optionally one queue or
address, every permission the user holds there and where it comes from: a role grant, a team role
or a share. A queue's **Access** panel shows its owner and who may act on it.

Every refused request is recorded in the audit trail, naming who, which permission and which
resource.

## For plugin authors

Plugin permissions declare their level too, and a plugin checks a queue or address through the
same resolver; see [Plugins](./plugins.md).
