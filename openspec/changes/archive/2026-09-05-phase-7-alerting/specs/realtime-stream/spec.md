## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: One multiplexed event stream per cluster

The system SHALL expose a single streaming endpoint that a client opens with a
cluster identifier and a set of topics, and that delivers named events for the
subscribed topics only. The supported topics SHALL include topology, health,
queues, events, consumers, sessions, connections, and alerts. A topic name the
endpoint does not recognise SHALL be ignored rather than rejected.

#### Scenario: Client subscribes to a subset of topics

- **WHEN** a client opens the stream for a cluster requesting only the topology topic
- **THEN** it receives topology events for that cluster and no queues or health events

#### Scenario: Events are scoped to the cluster

- **WHEN** state changes for one cluster
- **THEN** only clients subscribed to that cluster receive the event

#### Scenario: Client subscribes to the events topic

- **WHEN** a client opens the stream requesting the events topic
- **THEN** it receives broker-event payloads for that cluster and no topic it did not request

#### Scenario: Client subscribes to the alerts topic

- **WHEN** a client opens the stream for a cluster requesting the alerts topic
- **THEN** it receives an alerts signal event whenever that cluster's alert firing
  state changes, and no topic it did not request

### Requirement: Events are change signals derived from polling or push

Signal-topic events (topology, health, queues, consumers, sessions, connections,
alerts) SHALL each carry their topic, the cluster they concern, and a timestamp, and
SHALL signal that the topic's data has changed so the client can refetch it. A
signal-topic event SHALL be emitted only on an actual change: for a scrape-path
topic, only when a scrape tick changed that topic's persisted state; for a
push-path topic, only when a received notification implies that topic is stale;
for the alerts topic, only when an alert evaluation tick changes a firing state for
that cluster.

The events topic is the exception: it SHALL carry the full broker-event payload
and a monotonic event id, not a bare signal, and its events SHALL originate from
the push path.

#### Scenario: No change, no event

- **WHEN** a scrape tick produces the same topology and health as the previous tick
- **THEN** no topology or health event is emitted

#### Scenario: A queue depth change emits a queues event

- **WHEN** a scrape tick changes a queue's cached counters
- **THEN** a queues event for that cluster is emitted and subscribed clients refetch

#### Scenario: A notification carries data on the events topic

- **WHEN** a broker notification is received and persisted for a cluster
- **THEN** an events-topic message is delivered with the broker-event payload and a monotonic event id

#### Scenario: An alert transition emits an alerts signal

- **WHEN** an alert evaluation tick for a cluster causes a rule to start firing or
  resolve
- **THEN** an alerts signal event for that cluster is emitted and subscribed clients
  refetch

#### Scenario: An unchanged alert evaluation emits nothing

- **WHEN** an alert evaluation tick for a cluster produces no new firing or
  resolution
- **THEN** no alerts event is emitted for that tick
