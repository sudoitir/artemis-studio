## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The OpenAPI document is a versioned release artifact
Each release SHALL publish, among its GitHub release assets, the OpenAPI document of that version, named `artemis-studio-<version>.openapi.json`, with a SHA-256 checksum and build provenance. Its `info.version` SHALL be the release version. The running server SHALL serve the same document at `/v3/api-docs`, with `info.version` set to its own version.

#### Scenario: Release
- **WHEN** a version is released
- **THEN** its OpenAPI document is downloadable from the release, and it matches the document the running API serves

#### Scenario: Version discovery
- **WHEN** a client reads `/v3/api-docs`
- **THEN** `info.version` names the Studio version that serves it

### Requirement: Versioning and deprecation follow a documented policy
The documentation SHALL state how the API is versioned, how breaking changes are flagged and how endpoints are deprecated. A deprecated operation SHALL be marked `deprecated` in the document, and every response from it SHALL carry a `Deprecation` header (RFC 9745), a `Sunset` header (RFC 8594) and a `Link` header with `rel="deprecation"` pointing at its documentation.

#### Scenario: Deprecated endpoint
- **WHEN** a deprecated endpoint is called
- **THEN** the response carries the `Deprecation`, `Sunset` and `Link rel="deprecation"` headers
- **AND** the operation is marked deprecated in the document

#### Scenario: Pre-stable break
- **WHEN** a breaking change lands before the stable release
- **THEN** its commit carries the breaking marker (`!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:`), and the change is listed under Breaking in the release notes

### Requirement: Breaking API changes are detected in CI
CI SHALL compare the pull request's API document with the document of the latest release. It SHALL fail on a breaking change unless a commit in the pull request carries the breaking marker, and the failure SHALL name each breaking change. The same comparison SHALL be runnable locally.

#### Scenario: Unflagged break
- **WHEN** a pull request removes a response field and no commit carries the breaking marker
- **THEN** CI fails, naming the removed field and its operation

#### Scenario: Flagged break
- **WHEN** a pull request makes the same change and one of its commits carries the breaking marker
- **THEN** the compatibility check passes

#### Scenario: Compatible change
- **WHEN** a pull request only adds an optional field or a new endpoint
- **THEN** the compatibility check passes without a marker

### Requirement: List endpoints paginate one way
Every endpoint that returns a collection SHALL return the envelope `{data, page, pageSize, count, hasNext}` and accept `page` (1-based, default 1) and `size` (default 50, maximum 500). `count` MAY be null only where the total is unknown. No `/api/v1` endpoint SHALL return a bare JSON array. An out-of-range `page` or `size` SHALL be refused.

#### Scenario: Pagination
- **WHEN** a list is requested
- **THEN** the page size is bounded by 500, and `hasNext` tells whether another page exists

#### Scenario: Oversized page
- **WHEN** a list is requested with `size=501`
- **THEN** the request is refused with a problem of type `invalid-value`

### Requirement: Every error is problem+json with a stable type
Every error response from `/api/v1` SHALL be `application/problem+json` with a stable `type` under `https://artemis-studio.dev/problems/`. This SHALL hold for authentication and authorization failures, framework-level request errors, unknown routes and unexpected server errors. An unexpected server error SHALL NOT expose internal detail. The document SHALL describe the problem schema for every operation.

#### Scenario: Error shape
- **WHEN** any endpoint fails
- **THEN** the body is problem+json with a stable type

#### Scenario: Unauthenticated
- **WHEN** a request without credentials, or with an invalid bearer token, reaches `/api/v1`
- **THEN** the response is 401 with type `unauthenticated`

#### Scenario: Forbidden
- **WHEN** an authenticated caller lacks the permission for an operation
- **THEN** the response is 403 problem+json

#### Scenario: Malformed request
- **WHEN** a request has an unreadable body or an unsupported method
- **THEN** the response is 400 or 405 problem+json, not the server's default error page

### Requirement: Rate-limited responses carry standard headers
Every response to a rate-limited caller SHALL carry `RateLimit-Limit`, `RateLimit-Remaining` and `RateLimit-Reset`. Every 429 response from `/api/v1` SHALL carry `Retry-After`. The document SHALL describe these headers and the 429 response.

#### Scenario: Limited
- **WHEN** a request is refused with 429
- **THEN** the response carries `Retry-After` and a problem+json body

### Requirement: Mutating endpoints accept idempotency keys
Every `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` under `/api/v1`, except plugin-gateway routes, SHALL accept an `Idempotency-Key` header. The key SHALL be scoped to the calling user. A key SHALL be retained for 24 hours, and within that period a repeat of the same key and the same request (method, path, query and body) SHALL return the original status and body without applying the mutation again. A response that failed with a server error SHALL NOT be retained. The key's retention SHALL be governed with the other data stores.

#### Scenario: Retry
- **WHEN** a client repeats a request with the same key
- **THEN** the mutation is applied once and the same result returns, marked `Idempotent-Replayed: true`

#### Scenario: Key reuse with other body
- **WHEN** the same key is sent with a different request
- **THEN** it is refused with 422 and type `idempotency-key-reused`

#### Scenario: Concurrent repeat
- **WHEN** a repeat arrives while the first request with that key is still running
- **THEN** it is refused with 409 and type `idempotency-in-progress`

#### Scenario: Another caller's key
- **WHEN** a second user sends a request with a key the first user already used
- **THEN** the key is treated as the second user's own, and the first user's result is never returned

#### Scenario: Dry run and real run
- **WHEN** a client sends a real run with the key it used for the `dryRun=true` preview
- **THEN** the key is refused as reused, never answered with the preview's result

### Requirement: TypeScript and Java clients are generated and published
Each release SHALL publish a TypeScript client (`@artemis-studio/client` on npm) and a Java client (`io.github.sudoitir:artemis-studio-client` on Maven Central), both generated from that release's API document, versioned with the release, and published with provenance.

#### Scenario: Client release
- **WHEN** a release is published
- **THEN** both clients of that version are available

### Requirement: Contract tests keep implementation and document aligned
The build SHALL validate every JSON response produced in the API tests against the document's schema for that operation and status, and SHALL treat an undocumented property as a failure.

#### Scenario: Drift
- **WHEN** an endpoint returns a field the document lacks
- **THEN** the contract tests fail
