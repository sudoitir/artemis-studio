# queue-lifecycle Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change 01-queue-and-address-lifecycle. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Queues and addresses can be created and destroyed from Studio

The system SHALL allow an authorized operator to create a queue, destroy a queue,
create an address and destroy an address on a registered cluster, without leaving
the product for a broker CLI or a JMX console.

A queue creation SHALL carry the address it binds to, its routing type, its name,
and whether it is durable; a filter MAY be supplied at creation.

Destroying an address that still has queues bound to it SHALL be refused, and the
refusal SHALL name the bound queues, so that the operator destroys them
explicitly rather than through a single action whose blast radius is not stated.

#### Scenario: A queue is created across the cluster

- **WHEN** an operator creates a queue on a cluster
- **THEN** the queue exists on every live node of that cluster and the result
  reports the outcome for each node individually

#### Scenario: Creating a queue that already exists is not a failure

- **WHEN** an operator creates a queue that already exists on a node with the same
  configuration
- **THEN** that node is reported as already in the requested state, and the command
  is not treated as an error

#### Scenario: Creating a queue that exists with a different configuration is reported

- **WHEN** an operator creates a queue whose name already exists on a node with a
  different configuration
- **THEN** that node is reported as failed, and the report names how the existing
  configuration differs from the requested one

#### Scenario: An address with bound queues is not destroyed

- **WHEN** an operator destroys an address that still has queues bound to it
- **THEN** the operation is refused and the refusal names the bound queues

### Requirement: A lifecycle command targets the cluster and reports per node

The system SHALL accept a lifecycle command against a cluster rather than a single
node, SHALL determine the target nodes from observed live topology rather than from
stored configuration, and SHALL return an outcome for every node it considered.

Each node outcome SHALL state whether the operation was applied, would be applied,
was already satisfied, was skipped because the node was not live, or failed —
and, on a failure, why.

A node that is not live SHALL be reported as skipped rather than as failed, because
it never received the command.

The system SHALL NOT attempt to undo the nodes on which the operation succeeded
when it fails on another node. It SHALL instead report the resulting divergence.

#### Scenario: A node that is down is skipped, not failed

- **WHEN** a lifecycle command is issued to a cluster in which one node is not live
- **THEN** the live nodes are changed, the node that is not live is reported as
  skipped, and the command is not reported as failed on its account

#### Scenario: A partial failure leaves a reported divergence

- **WHEN** a lifecycle command succeeds on one node and fails on another
- **THEN** the nodes that succeeded are not reverted, the result names which node
  failed and why, and the cluster's divergent state is visible to the operator

#### Scenario: A retry after a partial failure converges

- **WHEN** an operator re-issues a lifecycle command after a partial failure
- **THEN** the nodes already in the requested state report as already satisfied and
  the previously failed node is attempted again

### Requirement: Every lifecycle command has a dry run

The system SHALL support previewing any lifecycle command without acting. A preview
SHALL name the nodes that would be affected and SHALL make no mutating call to any
broker.

For a destructive command, the preview SHALL additionally report how many messages
would be destroyed, per node.

#### Scenario: A preview touches no broker

- **WHEN** an operator previews a lifecycle command
- **THEN** the target nodes are reported and no broker is mutated

#### Scenario: A destructive preview reports what would be lost

- **WHEN** an operator previews destroying a queue that holds messages
- **THEN** the preview reports the number of messages that would be destroyed on
  each node

### Requirement: Destroying a queue is governed by the bulk safety cap

Destroying a queue destroys the messages it holds, and the system SHALL therefore
evaluate it against the same bulk safety cap as any other bulk destructive
operation, using the total message count across the target nodes.

A destroy whose estimate exceeds the cap SHALL be refused unless the caller
explicitly overrides the cap.

#### Scenario: Destroying a large queue is refused by default

- **WHEN** an operator destroys a queue holding more messages than the safety cap
- **THEN** the operation is refused and the refusal states the estimate and the cap

#### Scenario: An explicit override proceeds

- **WHEN** the same operator repeats the destroy with an explicit override
- **THEN** the operation proceeds and the override is recorded

### Requirement: A live queue can be paused, resumed, and reconfigured within limits

The system SHALL allow pausing and resuming a queue, resetting its message counter,
and changing the subset of its configuration that the broker accepts on a live
queue.

The system SHALL NOT offer to change configuration the broker will not accept on an
existing queue — in particular its routing type, which the broker refuses to change
on a live queue. Such fields SHALL be presented as immutable, with the reason,
rather than offered and then refused.

Where the broker's update operation replaces a queue's whole configuration rather
than merging into it, the system SHALL send the queue's complete configuration with
the operator's changes applied, so that a field the operator did not touch is not
silently cleared. A partial update SHALL NOT be forwarded to the broker as-is.

A paused queue SHALL be identifiable as paused in the cluster's queue view.

#### Scenario: A paused queue stops delivering

- **WHEN** an operator pauses a queue
- **THEN** the queue stops delivering to its consumers, retains its messages, and is
  shown as paused

#### Scenario: An immutable field is not offered for edit

- **WHEN** an operator opens a queue for editing
- **THEN** the routing type is shown as immutable with the reason, and cannot be
  submitted as a change

#### Scenario: An untouched field survives an update

- **WHEN** an operator changes one field of a queue whose configuration also sets a
  filter
- **THEN** the filter is unchanged after the update

### Requirement: Lifecycle operations are permission-gated and audited

The system SHALL require a distinct permission for creating, destroying, updating,
and pausing or resuming, resolvable at global, environment, or cluster scope. A
caller without the permission for a cluster SHALL NOT be able to learn whether that
cluster exists.

The system SHALL record one audit event per lifecycle command — not one per node —
capturing the actor, the cluster, the target, the parameters, whether it was a dry
run, and the per-node outcome. A command that failed on any node SHALL be recorded
as failed, with the per-node detail preserved.

#### Scenario: A caller without the grant learns nothing

- **WHEN** a caller without the create permission for a cluster issues a create
- **THEN** the request is rejected in a way that does not reveal whether the cluster
  exists

#### Scenario: A fan-out is one audit event

- **WHEN** a lifecycle command is applied across four nodes
- **THEN** a single audit event records the command and carries the outcome of all
  four nodes

#### Scenario: A partially applied command is recorded as failed

- **WHEN** a lifecycle command succeeds on two nodes and fails on a third
- **THEN** the audit event records the command as failed and its detail names which
  nodes applied and which did not
