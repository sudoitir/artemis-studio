 *   kept, and the query is not running. Stopping a tail is not a cancellation: the query had
 *   finished, so it reads as `done`.
 * - `disconnected` — the stream dropped. The query is *not* silently restarted:
 *   reconnecting would re-run a fan-out the operator did not ask for a second
 *   time, and would write a second audit record for one intent.
 *
 * A server that is shutting down sends `reconnect` first, which is the one exception: the

 * ticket, a new stream, and the rows start over) instead of reporting a disconnect.
