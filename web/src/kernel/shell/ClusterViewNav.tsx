/**
 * The per-cluster view nav (ADR-0034), grouped (ADR-0070). Each enabled feature contributes its
 * views to one of the kernel's groups; a group with no enabled view is not shown. Expanded, a group
 * has a visible title; collapsed, a divider, and its title stays available to a screen reader. The title
 * names its group but is not a heading: the page's headings are the page's own, starting at its one h1.
 * A view the operator lacks the read permission for stays listed and disabled, with the reason:
 * a missing entry would read as a product that cannot do it. Only rendered while a cluster is the
 * active route.
