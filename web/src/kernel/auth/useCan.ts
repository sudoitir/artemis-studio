 * counted as the server counts them.
 *
 * <p>`can(permission)` is about the whole installation. `can(permission, clusterId)` is about one cluster, and
 * `can(permission, { clusterId, kind, name })` about one queue or address, with a team's or share's rights counted.
 * Each is fetched the first time it is asked. Until it arrives the control is offered, as it is while grants load:
 * blocking on an answer not yet known would lock out someone the server lets in. For a resource permission the
 * cluster answer counts grants only; what a team or share gives on some queue or address is in the summary's
 * `anywhere`, and on one named queue or address in its own answer, or in the row's `allowedActions`.
 *
 * <p>`canAnywhere` is the page-level right: held on the cluster by a grant, or on some queue or address through a team
 * or a share. A control is hidden only when it is false. `canOn` is the right on one row the server sent, from the
 * row's `allowedActions`: false there is a control shown disabled, with its reason. `createPatterns` are the name
 * patterns a team or share lets the caller create queues and addresses under.
