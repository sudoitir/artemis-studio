 *   <li><b>Permission</b> — the caller's own grants. The server is the
 *       enforcement point; this only explains, and never hides.
 *   <li><b>Capability</b> — whether the broker connection can write at all. Only
 *       a known refusal blocks. Since ADR-0049 D5 an unproven capability is
 *       reported as unknown, and blocking on the absence of evidence would stop
 *       an operator using a broker that works perfectly well.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>`scope` is what the permission is held on, so the reason names the right place: `cluster` for
 * an action on one cluster (the usual one), `installation` for one on Studio itself, such as its
 * settings, users or plugins.
