# Fill the demo stack with traffic that looks like a working estate.
#
# Everything here goes through the product's own surfaces: the cluster is
# registered over Studio's REST API, and the messages are produced and consumed
# by the Artemis CLI that already ships inside the broker image. Nothing writes to
# `metric_sample`, `queue_snapshot` or any other table directly — a chart of
# invented samples tells you nothing about whether the product works, and it is
# the one thing a screenshot must not contain.
#
# The shape it builds, on purpose:
#   - several business-looking addresses at different rates;
#   - one address whose consumer is deliberately absent, so depth climbs and the
#     ingress/egress lines diverge — the picture an operator actually comes for;
#   - a real dead-letter backlog, produced by messages that were rejected;
#   - one stopped node, so the topology has a genuine warning rather than a staged
#     one.
#
# Metrics need real time to exist: tier B samples every 15s, so a credible 15m
# chart needs about that long. TRAFFIC_MINUTES controls it.
