/**
 * A node's declared connector names, read from the {@code ConnectorsAsJSON}
 * <em>attribute</em> — there is no operation that lists them, and the attribute
 * batches with everything else, so this costs one request and no MBean search.
 *
 * <p>A bridge names the connectors it uses, and a name the broker does not know is
 * accepted and silently ignored, so offering the real names is what stops an apply
 * from succeeding and deploying nothing. Where the attribute cannot be read the
 * answer is <em>unknown</em>, never an empty list: an absent name list would read as
 * "this broker has no connectors", which would send an operator looking for a
 * problem that is not there (ADR-0049 D5).
