 * ASF trademark policy discourages that, and precedent exists (Kafka Tool → Offset
 * Explorer). The decision to keep the name was made deliberately; see
 * {@code docs/adr/0001-project-name-and-trademark-risk.md}.
 *
 * <p>If the project is ever renamed, changing the constants here and their two
 * counterparts in {@code web/src/branding.ts}, plus the Maven {@code artifactId}
 * and image coordinates, is the entire job. Nothing else in the codebase should
 * hard-code the name.
