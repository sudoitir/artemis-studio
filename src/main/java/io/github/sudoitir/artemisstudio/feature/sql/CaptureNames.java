 * things have to be readable back out of that name, because the reconciler's only
 * view of actual state is the list of names a broker reports:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>the instance</b>, so one Studio never destroys another's tap;
 *   <li><b>the subscription</b>, so an orphan is recognised as one;
 *   <li><b>the source address</b>, so a drained message can be attributed to the
 *       address it was copied from without depending on a broker header (D2).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The subscription id goes last rather than second, which is the one place this
 * departs from the shape sketched in the design. An Artemis address routinely
 * contains dots — {@code ORDER.IN} is the ordinary case — so the address cannot be a
 * fixed segment; putting the fixed-width UUID at the end makes the address exactly
 * "everything in between" and the parse unambiguous.
