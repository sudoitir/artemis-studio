/**
 * What capture missed, per node (ADR-0062 D7).
 *
 * <p>The measurement is the change, between passes, in what was routed to the covered addresses
 * ({@code MessagesAdded} in {@code queue_snapshot}) that is neither stored nor still waiting in
 * the subscription's capture queues. A message in the ring has not been lost yet — counting it
 * would report every in-flight backlog as loss, and nothing would ever take it back. A positive
 * remainder is messages the ring dropped, or that arrived while the tap was not installed.
 *
 * <p>All three terms describe one instant: stored rows are counted up to the time of the queue
 * snapshot the other two come from, because rows stored after it would otherwise count against
 * routing the snapshot has not seen. What that leaves unmeasurable is a drain's in-flight batch —
 * read and not yet acknowledged, so both stored and still in the queue — which moves the figure
 * by up to one batch per drain either way. A rise is therefore reported only once it exceeds that
 * window twice over, measured from the lowest level seen since the last report: noise falls back
 * and never accumulates, while real loss keeps rising and is reported when it clears the window. There is deliberately no second gap metric.
 * The causes the drains recorded ({@link CaptureConsumer.Shortfall}) are named with it.
 *
 * <p>It is an estimate, and the product says so. Both terms come from sampled counters. What
 * it is reliable for is the thing that matters: a subscription steadily losing messages stops
 * being reported as healthy, and one that stops losing them is reported as healthy again.
 * Where it cannot be estimated — a divert filter captures part of the traffic by design — it is
 * stated as unavailable, never reported as zero (message-capture spec).
