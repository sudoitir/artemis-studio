/**
 * A run still recorded as executing by a replica that is gone was cut off by its stop or crash
 * (transfer design D6, ADR-0152). A run another live replica is executing is left alone; the others
 * are marked interrupted, once at startup and then every 30 seconds on one replica, and offered for resume: a move's held messages are safe in its durable
 * staging queue, and a copy's ledger says what it has copied. The large-message spool is swept by
 * {@code CoreRelay}; a staging queue whose run is gone shows as orphaned in the transfers list.
