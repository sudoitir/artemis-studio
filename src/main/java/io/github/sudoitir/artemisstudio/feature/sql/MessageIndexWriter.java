/**
 * Writes an observation into {@code message_index} (ADR-0059).
 *
 * <p>An update before an insert, rather than an upsert. The table is partitioned on
 * {@code observed_at}, which is therefore part of its primary key, so a second
 * observation of the same message carries a different key and {@code ON CONFLICT}
 * would never match it. Identity across observations is
 * {@code (node, queue, messageId)} — a prefix of the primary key, so the update finds
 * its row on the index that already exists.
 *
 * <p>What {@code last_seen_at} can honestly say is bounded by how the tail reads: it
 * advances only while a message is still returned by a poll, and a poll asks the
 * broker only for what is at or after the high-water mark. A message that sits on a
 * queue while newer ones arrive stops being re-read, so its {@code last_seen_at}
 * stops advancing — the alternative is re-reading whole queues every few seconds,
 * which is the one thing Studio must not do. "Is it still there?" is answered
 * exactly, on demand, by verifying the row against the live broker.
