/**
 * One queue's consumer-health verdict and the evidence it rests on (ADR-0089).
 *
 * <p>A verdict is never a bare label. Every field below is what the ladder read to reach
 * it, so an operator who disagrees with the verdict can see why it was reached, and a
 * wrong threshold is diagnosable rather than mysterious.
 *
 * <p>Every rate is boxed. {@code null} means "not computable from the samples available",
 * which is a different fact from zero — a queue nobody has sampled twice yet is not a
 * queue with no throughput, and rendering the first as the second is the misreading this
 * whole feature exists to prevent.
