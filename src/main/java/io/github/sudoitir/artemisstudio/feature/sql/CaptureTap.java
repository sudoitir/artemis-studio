/**
 * Installs and removes one capture tap on one node (ADR-0062 D1).
 *
 * <p>A tap is four broker objects, created in this order because each depends on the
 * one before it:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>address settings</b> on {@code artemis-studio.capture.#} —
 *       {@code addressFullMessagePolicy=DROP} so the broker never blocks or pages on
 *       Studio's account, and {@code expiryDelay} with
 *       {@code autoCreateExpiryResources=false} so an abandoned tap is bounded in age
 *       as well as in size. Artemis' own documentation warns against paging an address
 *       that holds ring queues, which is why this is part of the tap rather than an
 *       optional extra;
 *   <li><b>security settings</b> on the same match, restricting the capture queue to
 *       Studio's own broker role. The capture queue is a complete second copy of
 *       production payload, and creating it unguarded would hand a tap on production
 *       traffic to every client the broker authorises;
 *   <li><b>the capture queue</b> — non-durable, anycast, {@code ring-size} bounded, so
 *       the worst case with Studio dead forever is a fixed number of messages held in
 *       memory;
 *   <li><b>the divert</b> — non-exclusive, so production routing is untouched.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Removal is the reverse, and it is always an explicit act: none of these objects
 * disappears on a broker restart (ADR-0065). Both directions are idempotent, because
 * the reconciler is the only caller and it runs on a schedule.
 *
 * <p><b>Measured, not assumed.</b> Every management signature used here was checked
 * against the running broker rather than the classpath: {@code addSecuritySettings}'
 * single-JSON overload exists on the {@code ActiveMQServerControl} interface but is
 * <em>not</em> registered on the MBean, which answers with {@code IllegalArgumentException}
 * and lists the positional arms. The 13-string arm below is the one the broker accepts,
 * and its argument order — send, consume, createDurableQueue, deleteDurableQueue,
 * createNonDurableQueue, deleteNonDurableQueue, manage, browse, createAddress,
 * deleteAddress, view, edit — was confirmed by writing it and reading it back through
 * {@code getRolesAsJSON}.
