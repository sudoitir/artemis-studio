/**
 * The SSE fan-out (ADR-0018). One {@code Set<Subscriber>} per cluster;
 * {@link #publish} sends a tiny change-signal event to every subscriber that
 * asked for the topic. Events carry no data — the client refetches the matching
 * query key — so a broker that changes nothing produces only the heartbeat.
 *
 * <p>{@link #publish} does not deliver directly: it broadcasts a {@link BusFrame} to every replica
 * (ADR-0152), this one included, and each delivers it to its own subscribers when it arrives, so a
 * plugin publishing on one replica reaches the clients of all of them. The registry itself is
 * per-instance and does not survive a restart. The bus carries at most about 7 KB a frame: a larger
 * payload arrives as the plain {@code {topic,clusterId,ts}} signal, and the client refetches.
 *
 * <p>Delivery never blocks the caller, which is the bus dispatch thread: a frame is queued on each
 * subscriber, whose own virtual thread writes it ({@link Subscriber}). A client that stops reading
 * loses its queued frames to one {@link #RESYNC}; it does not delay the others.
