/**

 * belongs to an expectation.
 *
 * <p>Both halves live here so the sampler and the correlator cannot drift: if
 * {@link #resolve} browses an address that {@link #matches} would reject, a reply
 * is read and then discarded.
 *
 * <p>Resolution reads {@code queue_snapshot}, which the scrape loop already fills,
 * so a pattern costs no broker call at all and a reply queue created by a new
 * responder is picked up within one scrape cycle of appearing (design.md, D4). The
 * cost is that such a queue is invisible to tracing until that first scrape — the
 * right trade against resolving over the broker on every observation, which would
 * turn a per-message hot path into a per-message management call.
