/**
 * How far each broker's clock is from Studio's, measured for free from the
 * timestamp Jolokia already puts on every response (ADR-0053).
 *
 * <p>Keyed by Jolokia URL and shared across every client {@link BrokerClientFactory}
 * builds, mirroring the shape of the broker-MBean-name cache in
 * {@link JolokiaBrokerClient}: clients are rebuilt per call, so per-instance state
 * would be discarded before it could accumulate. No call site changes and no extra
 * broker request is made — non-negotiable #1 is untouched.
 *
 * <p>The estimator is the standard NTP one, cut down to what one field per
 * response supports. A reading is
 *
 * <pre>{@code offset = brokerMillis - (t0 + rtt / 2)}</pre>
 *
 * where {@code t0} is Studio's clock before the request and {@code rtt} the round
 * trip. The lowest-RTT reading is the least distorted by queueing in either
 * direction, so a reading is only allowed to teach the estimate when its round
 * trip is at or near the best seen; the rest are dropped. What survives is
 * smoothed by an EWMA so one outlier cannot move the verdict.
 *
 * <p>The best round trip decays slightly on every reading. Without that, a single
 * unusually fast response early on would lock the filter shut and no later reading
 * would ever be accepted.
