/**
 * Which queue to browse for a traced address, and how it is routed.
 *
 * <p>The sampler used to assume {@code (address, address, "ANYCAST")}. That is true
 * of the common case and wrong in two that matter: a multicast address is served
 * by queues whose names are the subscription, not the address, and an anycast
 * queue may simply be named differently from the address it is on. Both failed
 * every tick into a throttled warning the operator never saw, which is one of the
 * ways tracing could produce nothing and explain nothing.
 *
 * <p>Resolution reads {@code queue_snapshot}, which the scrape loop already fills,
 * so this costs no broker call — the same trade {@link ReplyAddressResolver}
 * makes, and the same consequence: a queue created since the last scrape is
 * invisible until the next one.
