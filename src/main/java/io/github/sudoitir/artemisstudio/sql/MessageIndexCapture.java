/**
 * Keeps one live tail running per index subscription (ADR-0059, task 6.4).
 *
 * <p>Capture is not a second reading mechanism. A subscription is exactly the query
 * {@code SELECT * FROM broker."<pattern>"}, tailed forever, with the rows written to
 * {@code message_index} instead of to an operator's screen — so everything the tail
 * already guarantees about broker load, permits and marks holds here unchanged, and
 * there is one place where a sampled read of a queue is implemented.
 *
 * <p>It follows that capture inherits the tail's honesty problem too: a message that
 * arrives and is consumed between two polls is never seen and therefore never
 * indexed. The index is a record of what was observed, which is what the UI says it
 * is.
 *
 * <p>The reconcile pass re-plans each subscription so that a queue created after the
 * subscription was is picked up. A plan is only swapped when its target set actually
 * changed, because restarting a tail re-primes its high-water marks to "now".
