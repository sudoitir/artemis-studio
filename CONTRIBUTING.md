# Contributing to Artemis Studio

Thanks for looking. The project is pre-alpha; the shape of things can still move.

## Before you write code

1. **Open an issue** describing the change. For anything that alters what the
   product does, we work it through [**OpenSpec**](https://openspec.dev) first
   (`openspec/`, `/opsx:propose`). Bug fixes and refactors don't need a proposal.
- One logical change per PR. Reference the issue and any ADR/[OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev) change.
2. **Check the ADRs** (`docs/adr/`). They're binding. A change that departs from
   one needs a new ADR in the same PR.
3. **Library questions** go through [**ctx7**](https://context7.com), not memory — versions and APIs in
   this space move, and we've been bitten.

## Development

```bash
just            # list tasks
just up         # dev stack (Postgres + Artemis primary/backup + Studio)
just verify     # what CI runs
just fmt        # Palantir Java Format (Spotless) + eslint --fix
```

- JDK 25, Node 22, Docker. Or open the dev container (`.devcontainer/`).
- Backend formatting is enforced (Spotless / Palantir) — `just fmt` before you
  commit, or CI will fail on the diff.
- Frontend: no raw colour/spacing literals in components — tokens only
  (`web/src/theme.ts` → `web/src/theme.css` → component). Logical CSS properties
  (`inline-start`, not `left`).
- Migrations: new Liquibase changeset, never edit a released one.

## Pull requests

- One logical change per PR. Reference the issue and any ADR/OpenSpec change.
- `just verify` green.
- New behaviour comes with a test at the user's altitude (Testing Library by
  role, MSW for the network; integration tests against the dev broker pair for
  backend broker code).
- Commits: imperative subject, explain *why* in the body when it isn't obvious.
